# ftx-body contract

**Purpose.** The Anny parametric body model (anny 0.6.1, the `create_fullbody_model` default
configuration of `docs/spec/05` §0) evaluated in Rust: phenotype and local-change coefficients, rest shape
and skeleton, local-bone forward kinematics, linear blend skinning, anthropometry, and the WHO
years-to-age-parameter map. Fitting, tape functionals and poses for the drape come next (FTX-09, FTX-10).

**Data.** `tools/body-model/convert_anny.py` builds the model from the pinned package into a fresh cache,
checks the installed files against the wheel's RECORD and every array against spec 05 §8.1, and writes a
`.ftxbody` file (~152 MB, outside the repository; `FTX_ANNY_MODEL` or
`~/.cache/franken_textiles/anny-0.6.1-default.ftxbody`). The reader refuses a wrong magic, version,
dtype, shape, index range, bone order or (with `verify`) SHA-256. Blend shapes are CSR-sparse f64,
reconstructing the package's dense array exactly.

**Units and frames.** Metres, +Z up, the body faces −Y, +X is the body's left. Rest bodies sit in the
template frame (soles near z = −0.82 m); posed bodies are root-relative. Nothing is grounded here.

**Parameters.** gender 0 = male, 1 = female. Age is morphological (−1/3 newborn anchor … 1), not years:
use `age_parameter_for_years`. Out-of-range phenotype values clamp; local changes extrapolate linearly
beyond ±1 and are absolute offsets authored on the adult mesh (spec 05 §3). Batch size 1.

**Oracle and fixtures.** `tests/fixtures/oracle/body/anny-0.6.1-reference.json` (16 cases from
`tools/body-model/capture_anny_reference.py`: newborn anchor, birth, 1 y, toddler, 6 y, 12 y, adults,
extremes, out-of-range, local changes beyond ±1, two poses). `tests/anny_parity.rs` compares selected
vertices, bounding boxes, checksums, bone frames and poses, coefficients and anthropometry (1e-9 m and
1e-10 relative; measured 1.05e-14 m and 1.1e-13), and re-hashes every loaded array to the package's bytes.
These tests are `#[ignore]`d without the converted model; run them with `--include-ignored`.

**Determinism class.** Fixed-order f64 arithmetic with `ftx-core::det` trig: bit-identical across targets.
The stored bone-roll matrices are the package's float32 values (not exactly orthonormal); the rigid
inverse uses their transpose, as the package does.

**Error model.** `Refusal`: `io` (file), `invalid_document` (malformed or inconsistent data),
`non_finite` (a parameter or delta), `out_of_range` (wrong vector lengths).

**No claims.** Fit quality against real people (that is FTX-09 and gate G1); the shape distribution's
weight and muscle priors (spec 05 §9.11); anything about the SMPL family or the `rig="anny"` preset.
